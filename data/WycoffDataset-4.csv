What is the core idea behind the Wyckoff Method?,Identify the path of least resistance by reading price–volume behavior to determine accumulation or distribution by large operators (the “Composite Man”).,Strategy Development
Who is the 'Composite Man' in Wyckoff’s framework and why does he matter?,A metaphor for dominant professional operators whose actions shape price and volume; studying his behavior helps align with smart money rather than trade against it.,Strategy Development
Name Wyckoff’s three fundamental laws.,"Supply and Demand, Cause and Effect, and Effort versus Result.",Strategy Development
How does the Law of Supply and Demand guide trade selection?,"When demand dominates (higher lows on expanding volume), favor long campaigns; when supply dominates (lower highs with supply swells), favor shorts or stay out.",Strategy Development
Explain the Law of Cause and Effect in practical terms.,The time and width of a trading range (cause) measured by point-and-figure counts projects the magnitude of the subsequent trend (effect).,Strategy Development
What does the Law of Effort vs. Result reveal?,"Compare volume (effort) to price spread and progress (result); a mismatch flags absorption, exhaustion, or hidden shifts in control.",Strategy Development
What market structure does Wyckoff focus on before trends start?,Trading ranges: Accumulation before uptrends and Distribution before downtrends.,Strategy Development
List the five phases of Accumulation.,Phase A: Stop the downtrend; Phase B: Build cause; Phase C: Spring/Shakeout; Phase D: Markup with SOS and LPS; Phase E: Trending.,Strategy Development
List typical events in Accumulation.,"PS (Preliminary Support), SC (Selling Climax), AR (Automatic Rally), ST (Secondary Test), Spring, Test, SOS (Sign of Strength), LPS (Last Point of Support).",Strategy Development
What defines a Spring in Accumulation?,"A false break below range support that swiftly reverses on demand, shaking out weak holders and testing supply.",Strategy Development
What is an LPS and why is it important?,A Last Point of Support: a higher low/pullback on light volume during Phase D that offers low-risk entries aligned with markup.,Strategy Development
How does Wyckoff define a Sign of Strength (SOS)?,"A rally with wide spreads and rising volume that decisively traverses the trading range, confirming demand dominance.",Strategy Development
What are the phases of Distribution?,Phase A: Stop the uptrend; Phase B: Build cause; Phase C: UT/UTAD; Phase D: Markdown with SOW and LPSY; Phase E: Trending down.,Strategy Development
Explain UT and UTAD.,Upthrust is a brief break above resistance that fails; UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution) is a terminal trap above the range before markdown.,Strategy Development
What is a SOW in Distribution?,Sign of Weakness: a sharp decline on increased volume across the range that indicates supply dominance.,Strategy Development
How does Change of Character (ChoCh) fit into Wyckoff analysis?,A sudden shift in volatility/spread/volume from one regime to another signals transition between phases or trend changes.,Strategy Development
What is the objective of Point-and-Figure (PnF) counts in Wyckoff?,To quantify the cause built in a range and project price objectives for the subsequent trend.,Strategy Development
How are PnF counts anchored during Accumulation?,Count horizontally across the range from the SOS/LPS region back to the left edge to project upside targets.,Strategy Development
How are PnF counts anchored during Distribution?,Count from SOW/LPSY across to the left edge to project downside targets.,Strategy Development
Why does Wyckoff emphasize context over single signals?,"Signals like Springs or UTs can fail; integrating phase, events, and effort/result reduces false positives.",Strategy Development
What timeframes does Wyckoff recommend aligning?,"Top-down: determine trend on higher timckeframes, then execute entries on lower ones within the same structural narrative.",Strategy Development
How do you confirm a Spring?,"Look for a quick recovery back into the range on expanding demand, followed by a low-volume test that holds above the spring low.",Strategy Development
What differentiates a Spring from a breakdown?,A spring has immediate rejection and absorption of supply; a breakdown retains heavy supply with poor recovery.,Strategy Development
How do you confirm a UT/UTAD?,"Observe failure back into the range on expanding supply, inability to follow-through, and rallies that become LPSY.",Strategy Development
What is absorption in Wyckoff terms?,"Large operators quietly absorb supply during a range, visible as narrowing spreads despite persistent volume.",Strategy Development
How is tape reading used in the method?,"By comparing bar-to-bar spread, close location, and volume to infer who controls the auction.",Strategy Development
What is the role of tests after a Spring?,"A successful test shows reduced supply (lower volume, narrower spreads) and validates entry risk.",Strategy Development
What is a BUEC in some Wyckoff literature?,"Back-Up to the Edge of the Creek: a pullback to broken resistance with light volume, often an LPS entry zone.",Strategy Development
What is the 'Creek' metaphor?,A series of minor resistances; crossing the creek with SOS suggests demand taking control.,Strategy Development
What is 'ICE' in Wyckoff terms?,Support level in a range; breaking the ICE with SOW confirms supply control.,Strategy Development
How does relative strength factor into selection?,Prefer instruments showing outperformance during corrections (for longs) or underperformance during rallies (for shorts).,Strategy Development
What is a campaign in Wyckoff practice?,"A multi-leg position managed over the markup/markdown phase, scaled in at LPS/LPSY and scaled out near objectives.",Strategy Development
How do you decide between early and conservative entries?,Early entries near Springs/UTs offer reward but higher failure risk; conservative entries wait for SOS/SOW and LPS/LPSY confirmations.,Strategy Development
How do you use preliminary support/resistance (PS/PSY)?,They signal the start of stopping action; watch for climactic behavior and subsequent AR to define the range.,Strategy Development
What is a 'no supply' bar?,"A narrow-spread down bar closing mid-to-high with notably lower volume, implying lack of selling pressure.",Strategy Development
What is a 'no demand' bar?,"A narrow-spread up bar closing mid-to-low with low volume, implying weak buying interest.",Strategy Development
Why track effort/result anomalies at edges of a range?,They often precede the terminal events (Spring/UTAD) and help anticipate the breakout direction.,Strategy Development
How are structural labels useful to risk placement?,Stops are logically set beyond Spring/UTAD lows/highs or behind SOS/SOW pivot levels to avoid noise.,Strategy Development
What is the role of swing characteristics in phase identification?,Widening spreads and higher volume on rallies (vs. pullbacks) indicate Phase D in accumulation; the reverse in distribution.,Strategy Development
How does one avoid overfitting to the schematic diagrams?,Treat schematics as archetypes; focus on the underlying principles and confirm with effort–result and relative strength.,Strategy Development
What confirms transition from Phase B to C?,"Multiple tests with drying volume and failed attempts to extend the prior trend, setting up for Spring/UT.",Strategy Development
How to handle re-accumulation during trends?,Identify smaller ranges that refresh the advance; use PnF on mini-causes to ladder targets and add at LPS.,Strategy Development
What is distribution-in-an-uptrend (DIAU)?,A topping range forming after an advance; failure of demand bars and upthrusts warn of control shift.,Strategy Development
How to spot absorption during pullbacks in markup?,"Downswings contract in spread and volume, closes hold mid-to-high, and supports are respected.",Strategy Development
What is a sign that accumulation is incomplete?,"Rallies fail to traverse the range, volume surges on upswings but result is poor, indicating supply still present.",Strategy Development
How to combine fundamentals with Wyckoff?,Use structure for timing and risk; let fundamentals/leadership screen the universe for candidates.,Strategy Development
What does 'testing after SOS' achieve?,"Confirms the breakout by showing that supply is absent at the new support, enabling add-on entries.",Strategy Development
How does volatility contraction inform phase analysis?,Shrinking spreads with steady volume suggests absorption; sudden expansion signals a change of character.,Strategy Development
When does a failed Spring become bearish information?,"If the market cannot re-enter the range and supply expands on declines, the spring attempt likely failed.",Strategy Development
How to distinguish PS/SC from ordinary support bounces?,"Look for capitulation signatures: very wide spreads, climactic volume, and immediate AR defining the range.",Strategy Development
Why are LPSY rallies attractive shorts?,They allow entries close to resistance with clear invalidation and alignment with markdown.,Strategy Development
How are objectives used for exits?,"Use PnF targets, prior structural levels, and signs of climactic action to scale out of the campaign.",Strategy Development
How to scale into a campaign per Wyckoff?,"Start small on initial confirmation (e.g., Spring test), add on LPS/LPSY and on breakouts with tests.",Strategy Development
What role do moving averages play in Wyckoff?,Optional aids for trend context; decisions rely primarily on structure and price–volume analysis.,Strategy Development
How to treat news within Wyckoff framework?,News often coincides with terminal events; trust the structure and effort–result over headlines.,Strategy Development
What is a 'jump across the creek' (JAC)?,A decisive SOS through layered resistance; follow-through and a light-volume backup validate it.,Strategy Development
What is 'fall through the ice' (FTI)?,A decisive SOW through support; failed rallies back to the breakdown level become LPSY.,Strategy Development
How to avoid traps around range edges?,"Wait for confirmation via swift return, volume behavior, and successful tests rather than trading the first break.",Strategy Development
What does a widening price spread on lower volume suggest?,Potential exhaustion or lack of participation; verify with next bars for absorption or failure.,Strategy Development
How to use comparative volume on up vs. down bars?,Dominant side shows wider spreads with proportionally supportive volume; the other side shows shortened effort.,Strategy Development
What is the danger of trading mid-range?,Poor reward-to-risk and higher noise; Wyckoff prefers entries at edges or on confirmed breakouts with tests.,Strategy Development
How do you frame invalidation?,"Define the level where the structural hypothesis is proven wrong (e.g., spring low broken on supply expansion).",Strategy Development
What is a 'terminal shakeout'?,"A deep, fast spring late in Phase C that clears stops before a strong SOS.",Strategy Development
Why might a UT not become a UTAD?,"If supply does not follow-through and price quickly reclaims resistance, distribution may be incomplete.",Strategy Development
How to judge if Phase B is doing its job?,"Persistent volatility and tests that fail to trend, with absorption signatures appearing over time.",Strategy Development
What is a 'minor sign of strength' (mSOS)?,"A smaller SOS within the range indicating improving demand, often preceding the major SOS.",Strategy Development
How to combine RS leaders with Wyckoff entries?,Select leaders in accumulation/re-accumulation and use LPS/BUEC entries to join the dominant uptrend.,Strategy Development
When is it appropriate to abandon a Wyckoff setup?,If effort–result turns adverse: wide spreads against your case on rising volume or repeated failed tests.,Strategy Development
How to identify campaign end via climactic action?,"Look for buying climax: ultra-wide up bars, gaps, high volume with poor follow-through and automatic reaction.",Strategy Development
What is 'ice to creek' flip?,"In markup, former resistance (creek) becomes support after SOS; in markdown, former support (ice) becomes resistance.",Strategy Development
How to treat gaps within Wyckoff analysis?,Breakaway and continuation gaps confirm control; exhaustion gaps often mark terminal phases.,Strategy Development
What are common mistakes novices make with Wyckoff?,"Forcing schematics, ignoring context, trading mid-range, and neglecting confirmation tests.",Strategy Development
How do you document a Wyckoff trade plan?,"Record phase, key events, hypothesis, entry, stop, adds, targets (PnF), and conditions to exit.",Strategy Development
What’s the role of intraday analysis for swing campaigns?,Use lower timeframes to refine tests and LPS entries while keeping higher-timeframe structure in focus.,Strategy Development
How to differentiate accumulation from redistribution in downtrends?,Redistribution shows failing rallies and SOWs; accumulation shows improving lows and SOS attempts.,Strategy Development
What signals early that a breakout might fail?,"Wide spread without proportional volume, immediate reversal, and heavy supply on the backup.",Strategy Development
How do you handle multiple ranges stacking?,Track nested causes; a larger primary target and smaller interim targets guide scaling and expectations.,Strategy Development
What is a 'stepping stone' count?,PnF count taken on re-accumulation ranges within an ongoing uptrend to project further targets.,Strategy Development
How does Wyckoff treat trendlines/channels?,As secondary tools to visualize stride; losing stride with effort–result anomalies can signal phase transition.,Strategy Development
How to use 'time' in Wyckoff analysis?,Longer and broader ranges build larger causes; premature breakouts without sufficient cause are suspect.,Strategy Development
What characterizes a quality test after Spring?,"Lower volume than the Spring, narrower spread, and a higher low that holds above support.",Strategy Development
What characterizes a quality backup after JAC?,Low-volume pullback that respects prior resistance turned support and forms an LPS.,Strategy Development
How do you distinguish climax vs. accumulation start?,"After a selling climax, look for AR and ST; without these, a single violent bar may just be volatility.",Strategy Development
What is 'effort without result' near resistance?,Heavy volume on up bars with little progress suggests supply; often precedes UT behavior.,Strategy Development
How does sector rotation interact with Wyckoff?,Use RS to locate sectors under accumulation and avoid those distributing; structure then times entries.,Strategy Development
What is the role of stops in Wyckoff campaigns?,Protect capital below structural invalidation points and adapt as structure evolves (trailing below LPS).,Strategy Development
When to add vs. when to wait?,Add on validated LPS/BUEC; wait during Phase B volatility until tests show supply drying up.,Strategy Development
What is a 'springboard' setup?,"A sequence of Spring → successful Test → SOS, indicating demand ready to propel markup.",Strategy Development
How to use OCO (One Cancels Other) logic with targets and stops?,Place protective stops at invalidation and staged targets from PnF; hit one and cancel the other leg.,Strategy Development
How to detect hidden absorption during a rally pause?,"Sideways drift with declining volume and tight closes near highs, then resumption with SOS.",Strategy Development
Why monitor close location relative to range?,Closes near highs on up bars indicate demand; near lows on down bars indicate supply.,Strategy Development
What is a 'test in a rising market'?,"A brief dip with very low volume that holds above prior supports, confirming lack of supply.",Strategy Development
How to read wide-spread down bars in Phase B?,"If immediately retraced on better demand, it’s absorption; if followed by weakness, supply still dominates.",Strategy Development
What does repeated failure to break resistance imply?,Distribution or incomplete accumulation; watch for UT/UTAD or more building cause.,Strategy Development
How to manage trades around earnings using Wyckoff?,"Enter from structure well before events; if uncertain, reduce size and re-enter on post-event tests.",Strategy Development
What is a 'shakeout and test' sequence?,A spring-like flush followed by a low-volume retest that validates demand control.,Strategy Development
How do you reconcile conflicting signals across instruments?,Favor clearer structures and stronger RS; skip ambiguous charts to preserve expectancy.,Strategy Development
What is 'secondary test in Phase A'?,A retest of the SC/BC area to verify if supply has been exhausted or remains active.,Strategy Development
How to treat failed LPS that undercuts support?,Consider the hypothesis invalidated; either Phase C is not finished or distribution is underway.,Strategy Development
When does a range stop building cause and start trending?,After SOS/SOW with persistent follow-through and successful backups/tests indicating control shift.,Strategy Development
What’s the simplest Wyckoff entry checklist?,"Identify phase, confirm terminal event (spring/UT), validate test, see SOS/SOW, enter at LPS/LPSY with clear stop.",Strategy Development
How to integrate risk/reward into selection?,Prefer structures with nearby invalidation and PnF targets yielding ≥3:1 reward-to-risk.,Strategy Development
What is the value of journaling Wyckoff reads?,"It sharpens pattern recognition, reduces hindsight bias, and improves discipline in execution.",Strategy Development
How to differentiate absorption vs. distribution at highs?,"Absorption: narrowing spreads, light volume on pullbacks; Distribution: upthrusts, failure on rising supply.",Strategy Development
What is 'effort–result bullish divergence'?,"Heavier down-volume produces smaller declines (absorption), implying demand strengthening.",Strategy Development
What is 'effort–result bearish divergence'?,"Heavy up-volume produces little upside progress (capping supply), implying distribution.",Strategy Development
How to confirm Phase D in Accumulation?,"Presence of SOS traverses, rising highs/lows, and pullbacks that behave as LPS on light volume.",Strategy Development
How to confirm Phase D in Distribution?,"Presence of SOW breaks, lower highs/lows, and rallies that behave as LPSY on light volume.",Strategy Development
